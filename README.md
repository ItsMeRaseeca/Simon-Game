What is Simon Game?
Simon is an electronic game of short-term memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison in 1978, working for toy design firm Marvin Glass and Associates,[1] with software programming by Lenny Cope. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over.
